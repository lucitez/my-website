        While working for Rich Uncles, LLC this summer I helped develop
        v1.0 of the web app for Perks, a local business-focused rewards
        program. The website was built with React using a Redux framework.
        I helped construct and refactor components in a separate repository that
        are throughout the web app. I also contributed to conversations about
        user experience, helping to design flows for onboarding, profile updates,
        and inviting friends to the service.

        I loved learning about React and how to use Redux to really take
        advantage of a componentâ€™s state. One of my favorite things I contributed
        to the project was a field repeater that automatically creates new fields
        when all of the current fields are filled up.
